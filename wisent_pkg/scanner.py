    'Source' must iterate over the lines of input (it could for
    example be a file-like object).  The generator then yields
    4-tuples consisting of a type string, a value, the line number
    (starting with 1) and the column number (starting with 1): if the
    type string is one of "token" or "string", the value is the
    corresponding input character sequence.  Otherwise both the type
    string and the value are the same, single input character.

    If the input ends in an unterminated string or comment, a
    SyntaxError exception is raised.
